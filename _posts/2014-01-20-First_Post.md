This is my first post. I'm gonna talk about my plans.

## Put down my everyday life

	I wanna go to MIT, and I'm now struggling for it. It gonna be fun for me to look back years later. Whatever which college I might attend, this memory must be precious. And there're also something fun but not big enough for me to memorize. So I gonna put them down in order to look back someday. Certainly, they are open to everyone :).

## Post codes for fun

	I sometimes write something fun. I would post the code in order to share the fun.

## Post answers
	
	I'm an OIer, so I would post answers to those OI/ACM problems as well as something non-OI/ACM-related but fun enough.

## (The biggest target) SICP answer, the Chinese version.
	
	So far, there is no satisfactory(at least no satisfactory for me) Chinese-version answerbook to the practices included in the SICP. Yet I believe(May I be pretentious for one second :P) I'm capable of getting this done. So I gonna try it out. 

### Have fun guys 玩得开心w
